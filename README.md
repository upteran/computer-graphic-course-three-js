# Computer Graphic Course

This project demonstrates the use of Three.js to create interactive 3D visualizations in a web environment. It includes two primary examples: 
a dynamic function grapher that visualizes various mathematical surfaces and a geometric structure composed of spheres and connecting cylinders. 
The project is intended to serve as a learning tool for those interested in computer graphics, 3D modeling, and the basics of WebGL using Three.js.
